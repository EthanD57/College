This project is for a simple graphics library to run on a modified version of TinyCore Linux running in QEMU. It directly opens and modifies the framebuffer to draw pixels, lines, text, and rectangles. I did not write any code within the iso_font.h header file. All of the code in that file was written by Apple. To run the code, compile all files and link them to the graphics_driver.c file. Then run the executable in QEMU. The code will draw a series of shapes and text to the screen.
