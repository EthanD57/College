This project showcases the speed differences between implementations of web server parallelism methods. The methods used are: Caching, Multi-process, and Multi-threading. 

# How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile whatever server you would like to run
3. Run the server with sudo ./objectNAME
4. Run the python script with 5 text files in the local directory

All of the code dealing with parallelism was written by me. All of the code dealing with the web server and GET requests was written by John Misurda.
