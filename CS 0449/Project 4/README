This project is a simple shell. You can use two built-in commands "load" and "exit". "load" should be used with a plugin name (ex. load plugin1). All plugins are assumed to have functions "initialize" and "run". To use the "run" function in a plugin, do "pluginName args". A variable number of arguments can be passed into a plugin "run" function. Finally, the shell supports the use of OS terminal commands such as "ls" by simply typing in the command and arguments.
