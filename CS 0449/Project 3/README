This project explores the use of assembly language and how it is used to compile C code. The goal of this project is to defuse a bomb by figuring out the correct input to defuse it. The bomb is a compiled C program that was provided by the professor. The second part of the project is to exploit a program that was written in C. The program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The goal of this part of the project is to change the output of the program and to execute the wrong function.

All code was provided by the professor and is not my own.
