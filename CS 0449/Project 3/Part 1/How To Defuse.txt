PHASE 1: Look at line 14e7 in phase 1 function. It is comparing 0xfffffd31 to my input. 0xfffffd31 is 4294966577

PHASE 2: Do "break strings_not_equal". Then do "continue". Finally do "x $rsi". Rsi is the register passed into strings_not_equal and is the key. 

PHASE 3: On line 152a, it is comparing the first number to 2 and explodes if it isn't. In line 1530, it is comparing to 1 and explodes if it is not. 
In lines 1559, 155c, and line 155f, it is checking that the i-1 and i-2 number is equal to i or the Fibonacci sequence.  

PHASE 4: So first thing I did was "break phase_4". Then I did "continue". Then I did "break strings_not_equal". Do "continue" again 
and then do "x $rsi". I did this because on line 15c4, it's clearly loading in something to compare my string to. 

Then do: 

Look at line 158d and 1590. It's looking to see that my string is at least 10 long. 

Next look at lines 1592 and 1597. This loades 0 and 1 to edx and eax. 

Next the function compares the two letters which should be the same at the starting index of "jokes" and 1st index of the input string.

Next it adds 2 to my input string and 1 to the "jokes" string and compares again.

Basically it checks that every other character in the input string is the same as the "jokes" string.

So any string that is at least 10 long and every other character is the letters in "jokes" will work.
