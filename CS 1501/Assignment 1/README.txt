This is the first assignment for CS1501. The only file that I wrote is Crossword.java. All
other files were provided by the professor. The purpose of this assignment was to create a
program that would solve a crossword puzzle. The program takes in a dictionary file and a
crossword file and outputs the solution to the crossword puzzle. The program uses a
recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
