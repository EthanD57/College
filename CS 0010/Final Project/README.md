## Our Mission:
We will be investigating the best area in Pittsburgh to do <b>hard drugs</b> (but we do <strong>not</strong> recommend this action). 

#### Our data will be drawn from the metrics:

* Number of drug possesion charges within a neighborhood
* Number of arrests within a neighborhood
* Number of people who make a lot of money within a neighborhood


#### Our single metric will be "Drug Points"

This metric will be used to rate all of the neighborhoods in the data set based off one linear scale. This number will be calculated using our scientifically perfect formula: 
> **100 x (0.5 x Number of households which make above 200K) + (4 x Number of drug possesion charges)) / (1.5 x Arrests within that neighborhood)**
