This is a simple car dealer website that I made for my web development class.
Users can select from 3 different car makes, and then select 3 colors per make. 
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and updates as the user makes selections.
No images are included with this for copyright reasons, but you can easily add your own images by making an "Images" folder and adjusting the relative file paths in the HTML/JS files.
