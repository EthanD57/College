/******** FREE LIST IMPLEMENTATION ***********************************/


/* An BlockInfo contains information about a block, including the size
   as well as pointers to the next and previous blocks in the free list.
   This is similar to the "explicit free list" structure illustrated in
   the lecture slides.

   Note that the next pointer are only needed when the block is free. To
   achieve better utilization, mm_malloc should use the space for next as
   part of the space it returns.

   +--------------+
   |     size     |  <-  Block pointers in free list point here
   |              |
   |   (header)   |
   |              |
   |     prev     |
   +--------------+
   |   nextFree   |  <-  Pointers returned by mm_malloc point here
   |   prevFree   |
   +--------------+      (allocated blocks do not have a 'nextFree' field)
   |  space and   |      (this is a space optimization...)
   |   padding    |
   |     ...      |      Free blocks write their nextFree/prevFree pointers in
   |     ...      |      this space.
